Shape Area (JS) 

Define an n-interesting polygon. Find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. 
An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side.
